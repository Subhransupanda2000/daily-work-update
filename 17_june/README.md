# DDL

* DDL commands deal with defining the structure of database. Here are some common DDL commands:
```
CREATE: Used to create new database objects like tables, views, indexes, etc.
ALTER: Allows modifying the structure of existing objects.
DROP: Used to delete database objects entirely.
```
* DML (Data Manipulation Language): DML commands focus on manipulating data within the database. Some important DML commands include:

```
INSERT: Used to add new rows of data to a table.
UPDATE: Allows modifying existing data in a table.
DELETE: Used to remove rows from a table.
```
* DQL is fetching and manipulating data retrieved from the database.
```
SELECT: This is the workhorse for retrieving filter data based on conditions, and sort the results.
```
