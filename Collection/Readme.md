# Collection framework practice Notes
```
Array has few issues thats why collection got introduced
1. Array is fixed in size
2. Array is Homogenous can store only same data types
3. There is no standard data structre.so that there is no redymed method available. We need to write explicitly
To overcome above problems we should go for collection concept
```
