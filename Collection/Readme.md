# Collection framework practice Notes
```
Array has few issues thats why collection got introduced
1. Array is fixed in size
2. Array is Homogenous can store only same data types
3. There is no standard data structre.so that there is no redymed method available. We need to write explicitly
To overcome above problems we should go for collection concept
```
# Collection
```
1. Collection are growable in nature. There is no fixed size.
2.Collection is also Heterogenous different type of data we can store
3. Readymed method support is avaliable.
```
# Difference between Arrays and collections
```
Arrays:
1 .Fixed size
2. Meomory wise Arrays not recomended
3. Perfomance wise Arrays  recomended
4.Homogenous
5. Redymade methods are not there
6. Arrays can hold both primitime and object type data
Collections:
1.Growable
2.Memory wise collection not recomended 
3. Perfomance wise Collections not recomended
4. Heterogenous
5. Readymade method support is there
6. Collections can hold  only  object type data

```
