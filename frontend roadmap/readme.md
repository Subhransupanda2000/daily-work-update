Frontend Developer Roadmap (Step-by-Step) 🚀
Since you're already a Full-Stack Java Developer and have experience with React, Redux, and Context API, this roadmap will help you master frontend development with a focus on React, UI frameworks, performance optimization, and deployment.

🗓️ Roadmap Breakdown (6-Month Plan)
Month	Topics to Cover
1	HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals
2	Advanced JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, Async Programming
3	React Basics, JSX, Components, Props, State
4	React Hooks, Context API, Redux Toolkit
5	React Router, API Integration, Authentication
6	Performance Optimization, Testing, Deployment
🔹 Month 1: HTML, CSS & JavaScript Fundamentals
⏳ Time: 2-4 Weeks (Skip if you're comfortable)
✔ Goal: Learn the basics of frontend development.

✅ Topics to Cover:

HTML5 – Semantic tags, Forms, Accessibility (ARIA).
CSS3 – Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Media Queries.
JavaScript (ES6+) – Variables (let, const), Functions, Loops.
DOM Manipulation – document.querySelector(), Events.
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Build a responsive portfolio website using HTML & CSS.
✅ Implement a color-changing button using JavaScript.

🔹 Month 2: Advanced JavaScript & Async Programming
⏳ Time: 3 Weeks
✔ Goal: Learn JavaScript deeply before moving to React.

✅ Topics to Cover:

ES6+ Features – Arrow Functions, Template Literals, Spread/Rest.
Event Loop & Asynchronous JS – Callbacks, Promises, async/await.
Fetch API & Axios – Making API calls, handling errors.
LocalStorage, SessionStorage – Persisting data in the browser.
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Build a To-Do App using vanilla JavaScript with LocalStorage.
✅ Fetch data from JSONPlaceholder API and display it dynamically.

🔹 Month 3: React Basics
⏳ Time: 4 Weeks
✔ Goal: Learn how to create React applications.

✅ Topics to Cover:

React Basics – Components, JSX, Props, State.
Handling Events & Forms – onClick, onChange, useState.
React Lifecycle Methods – useEffect, componentDidMount().
React Developer Tools – Debugging in React.
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Build a Counter App using React.
✅ Create a Form with validation using useState.

🔹 Month 4: React Hooks, Context API & Redux
⏳ Time: 4 Weeks
✔ Goal: Manage global state efficiently.

✅ Topics to Cover:

React Hooks – useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef.
Context API – Global state management without Redux.
Redux Toolkit – createSlice(), useSelector(), useDispatch().
Middleware in Redux – Thunk & Saga.
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Convert a React class-based component into a functional component using Hooks.
✅ Implement Redux for a shopping cart application.

🔹 Month 5: React Router, API Integration & Authentication
⏳ Time: 4 Weeks
✔ Goal: Make full-stack applications using APIs.

✅ Topics to Cover:

React Router – Dynamic Routes, Protected Routes.
API Calls in React – Fetching & posting data.
Authentication in React – JWT Authentication, OAuth.
Error Handling & Loading States – Skeleton loading UI.
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Build a Blog App with authentication (JWT).
✅ Create a pagination component for fetching API data.

🔹 Month 6: Performance Optimization, Testing & Deployment
⏳ Time: 4 Weeks
✔ Goal: Optimize React apps for speed & deploy them.

✅ Topics to Cover:

Performance Optimization – Memoization (useMemo, useCallback).
Code Splitting & Lazy Loading – React.lazy(), Suspense.
Testing React Apps – Jest, React Testing Library.
Deployment – Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, AWS S3.
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Optimize an existing React project using React.memo().
✅ Deploy a React app to Vercel or Netlify.
