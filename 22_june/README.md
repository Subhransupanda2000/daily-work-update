# Ans:
* 1)An array is an indexed collection of fixed number of homogeneous data elements.
* The main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values with the same name
so that readability of the code will be improved.
* But the main disadvantage of arrays is:
Fixed in size that is once we created an array there is no chance of increasing or
decreasing the size based on our requirement that is to use arrays concept compulsory
we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.
We can resolve this problem by using collections.
# Array declarations:
# Single dimensional array declaration: 
* int[] a;
int []a;
int a[];
At the time of declaration we can't specify the size otherwise we will get compile time
error.
# Two dimenssional arrays
# Two dimensional array declaration:
Example:
int[][] a;
int [][]a;
int a[][]; 
int[] []a;
int[] a[];
# Three dimensional array declaration:
Example:
int[][][] a;
int [][][]a;
int a[][][];
int[] [][]a;
int[] a[][]; All are valid.(10 ways)
int[] []a[];
int[][] []a;
int[][] a[];
int []a[][];
int [][]a[];
