Java Learning Path (Step-by-Step) 🚀
Since you're already a Full-Stack Java Developer, this roadmap focuses on advanced concepts needed for Spring Boot, Microservices, and DevOps.

🔹 Month 1: Java Fundamentals & OOP (If Needed)
⏳ Time: 2-4 Weeks (Skip if you're comfortable)
✔ Goal: Master OOP principles & core Java features.

✅ Topics to Cover:
1️⃣ Java Syntax & Basics

Variables, Data Types, Operators
Loops (for, while, do-while), Conditionals (if-else, switch)
2️⃣ OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
Interfaces & Abstract Classes
Method Overloading & Overriding
Access Modifiers (private, protected, public)
Static & Final Keywords
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement a Bank Account System using OOP concepts.

🔹 Month 2: Collections Framework & Generics
⏳ Time: 2 Weeks
✔ Goal: Work with Java collections efficiently.

✅ Topics to Cover:
1️⃣ Java Collections Framework

List (ArrayList, LinkedList), Set (HashSet, TreeSet)
Map (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap)
Queue (PriorityQueue, Deque)
Sorting with Comparator & Comparable
2️⃣ Generics & Wildcards

List<T>, Map<K, V>, Class<?>, extends, super
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement a Custom Cache System using HashMap.
✅ Solve DSA problems using Collections.

🔹 Month 3: Java 8+ Features (Modern Java)
⏳ Time: 3 Weeks
✔ Goal: Learn Functional Programming & Stream API.

✅ Topics to Cover:
1️⃣ Lambda Expressions & Functional Interfaces

Predicate<T>, Consumer<T>, Supplier<T>, Function<T, R>
BiFunction, UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator
2️⃣ Stream API

Filtering, Mapping, Sorting (map(), filter(), sorted())
Reduction (reduce())
Collecting (collect(Collectors.toList()))
3️⃣ Optional Class

Optional.of(), Optional.empty(), Optional.orElse()
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Refactor a traditional loop-based program to Stream API.
✅ Write a Custom Functional Interface.

🔹 Month 4: Multithreading & Concurrency
⏳ Time: 3 Weeks
✔ Goal: Handle parallel execution & optimize performance.

✅ Topics to Cover:
1️⃣ Threads & Runnable

Creating Threads (Thread, Runnable, Callable, ExecutorService)
Thread states (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED)
2️⃣ Concurrency & Synchronization

synchronized keyword
Locks (ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock)
volatile, AtomicInteger, CountDownLatch, Semaphore
3️⃣ CompletableFuture & Parallel Streams

Asynchronous Programming using CompletableFuture
Parallel Streams (parallelStream())
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement Multithreaded File Processing System.
✅ Use ExecutorService to run parallel tasks.

🔹 Month 5: Design Patterns & Best Practices
⏳ Time: 3 Weeks
✔ Goal: Write clean & maintainable code using design patterns.

✅ Topics to Cover:
1️⃣ Creational Patterns

Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
2️⃣ Structural Patterns

Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Composite
3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns

Strategy, Observer, Command, Chain of Responsibility
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Implement a Factory Pattern for Database Connection.
✅ Design a Strategy Pattern for Payment Processing.

🔹 Month 6: Advanced Java & Spring Boot Integration
⏳ Time: 4 Weeks
✔ Goal: Connect Java skills with real-world Spring Boot development.

✅ Topics to Cover:
1️⃣ JDBC & Database Connectivity

JDBC API, Connection Pooling (HikariCP)
Working with MySQL/PostgreSQL
2️⃣ Logging & Debugging

SLF4J, Logback, Log4j
Using Debugger in IntelliJ/Eclipse
3️⃣ Memory Management & Performance Optimization

Java Memory Model (Heap, Stack, Metaspace, Garbage Collection)
JVM Tuning (-Xms, -Xmx, -XX:+UseG1GC)
🎯 Hands-on Practice:
✅ Profile a Java app and optimize memory usage.
✅ Implement Database Connection Pooling using HikariCP.
